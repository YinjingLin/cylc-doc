.. note::

   Cylc |release| is the final *beta* pre-release of Cylc 8. It is largely
   complete and can be used to manage real workflows, but it has not yet been
   heavily tested by users. Python 2 based Cylc 7 is stable and still available
   if needed for production systems.

   Please report migration issues to the `Cylc Discourse Forum (7-to-8 topic)`_.
