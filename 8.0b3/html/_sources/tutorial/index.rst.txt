.. warning::

   This tutorial has been upgraded for Cylc 8 syntax and working practices but
   it still contains screenshots of the obsolete Cylc 7 desktop GUI, and parts
   of the *runtime* section still use a command from the ``Rose`` project to
   copy workflow source files.

This section will cover the Cylc framework and writing basic Cylc workflows.
