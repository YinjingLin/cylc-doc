Runtime
=======

.. warning::

   This section of the tutorial still contains some screenshots of the obsolete
   Cylc 7 desktop GUI, and parts of it still use a command from the ``Rose``
   project to copy workflow source files.


This section covers:

* Associating tasks with scripts and executables.
* Providing executables with runtime configurations.
* Running Cylc workflows.
