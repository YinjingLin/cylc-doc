# This file configures the Jekyll static web builder (https://jekyllrb.com/) as
# used by Github Pages.

# Jekyll treats directories beginning with underscores as having special meaning
# and omits them from the build. This can be overridden by manually including
# directories using "include".
# https://help.github.com/articles/files-that-start-with-an-underscore-are-missing/
# NOTE: Only the directory name should be specified not the full path.
